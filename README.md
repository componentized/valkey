## Build

A [dev container](https://containers.dev) is available that contains the necessary tools and configuration out of the box.

Prereqs:
- a rust toolchain
- [`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall), optional, to download prebuilt tools instead of building them

```sh
make components
```

The build creates each component in [`components`](./components) into `target/components`, e.g. the cli at `target/components/cli/cli.wasm`, along with `target/components/interface.wasm`, the `componentized:valkey` WIT package. Each component is also built with debug info, e.g. `target/components/cli/cli.debug.wasm`.

The cli tools the build uses, [`wasm-tools`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools), [`wac`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac), [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime) and [`wkg`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools), are pinned in [`tools/Cargo.toml`](./tools/Cargo.toml) and installed into `target/tools/<platform>`, e.g. `target/tools/aarch64-apple-darwin`, as needed, or ahead of time with `make tools`. Dependabot bumps the pinned versions.

## Run

Prereqs:
- build the components (see above)
- a `wasi:cli/command` compatible runtime (like [wasmtime](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime))
- access to a running [Valkey](https://valkey.io) server

```sh
wasmtime run -Sinherit-network -Sallow-ip-name-lookup target/components/cli/cli.wasm keys '*'
```

- use `--host` to specify a host other than `127.0.0.1`
- use `--port` to specify a port other than `6379`
- `-Sallow-ip-name-lookup` is only required if a hostname is used for the connection instead of an IP address.

To aid incremental development a make target is available to rebuild and run the CLI:

```sh
make run cmd="hello"
```
