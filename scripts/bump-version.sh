# Updates the package declaration and every reference to the package in tracked files, then
# refreshes the generated wit dependencies. The crates share the interface's version: the
# workspace version the crates inherit, and the workspace's requirement on the library, move to the
# new version too. Items whose `@since` names an unreleased (prerelease)
# version move to the new version, since they were never published under the old one. Items
# released under the old version keep their `@since`.
#
#   0.1.0-dev -> 0.1.0      releases 0.1.0, `@since(version = 0.1.0-dev)` becomes 0.1.0
#   0.1.0     -> 0.2.0-dev  starts 0.2.0, `@since(version = 0.1.0)` is unchanged
